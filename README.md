# my kickstart.nvim config

After about 8 years of stubbornly clinging to the same vim config - a monstrosity of over 2000 lines of undocumented code, half of which I couldn't explain if my life depended on it - I've finally decided to bite the bullet and update my config. Because apparently, teaching an old dog new tricks is easier than deciphering my own ancient vim hieroglyphs.

To use this config,
```
git clone git@github.com:gokulp01/nvim-dotfiles.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```
